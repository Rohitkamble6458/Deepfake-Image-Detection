## Project Overview

With the rapid advance of AI technologies, deepfake content—synthetic images or videos created through AI manipulation—has become a serious threat to digital authenticity, privacy, and social trust. This project develops machine learning models to effectively distinguish genuine images from deepfakes, thus helping to mitigate risks from misinformation and fraudulent media.

---

## Problem Statement

Deepfake technology, especially using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can create highly realistic synthetic media that are difficult to detect visually. This makes manual verification impractical at scale. There is a critical need for automated, accurate, and interpretable detection systems to identify manipulated images and maintain trust in digital media.

---

## Objectives

- Develop sophisticated algorithms based on CNNs and transfer learning capable of high-accuracy detection of manipulated images.  
- Design a scalable, efficient system suitable for large volumes of image input.  
- Provide clear, interpretable explanations for model decisions using techniques such as LIME to increase user trust.  
- Create an intuitive web interface allowing users to easily upload images and receive classification results.  
- Promote education and awareness on deepfake technology and digital media authenticity.

## Methodology

The approach systematically covers data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, explainability, and deployment:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Assemble a diverse dataset with labeled real and fake images. Images are resized to 224×224, normalized, and augmented to increase robustness.  
- **Model Training:** Two models are built — a custom CNN trained from scratch and a fine-tuned pre-trained Xception model leveraging transfer learning.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC are used to assess performance on a reserved test set.  
- **Explainability:** LIME technique highlights image regions influencing model decisions to improve transparency.  
- **Web Integration:** A Flask-based web application allows users to upload images and view classification results and explanations interactively.

## Model Training

1. **Custom CNN:**  
   - Consists of convolutional layers with ReLU activations, max pooling, dropout to prevent overfitting, and fully connected dense layers with a sigmoid output for binary classification.  
   - Optimized using binary cross-entropy loss.

2. **Pre-trained Xception Model:**  
   - Retains base layers for feature extraction and fine-tunes custom classifier layers for real/fake discrimination.  
   - Utilizes transfer learning to accelerate training and improve accuracy.

---

## Model Evaluation

Performance on test datasets demonstrates:

- **Accuracy:** 81.87%  
- **Precision:** 79.78%  
- **Recall:** 85.37%  
- **F1 Score:** 82.48%  

### Confusion Matrix

|                  | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive**  | 1254 (TP)          | 346 (FN)           |
| **Actual Negative**  | 234 (FP)           | 1366 (TN)          |

Confusion matrix results reflect effective classification with balanced true positives and negatives.

## Model Explainability

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is implemented to provide visual explanations that highlight areas of an image influential in the model’s classification. This fosters user trust and facilitates feedback for continuous model improvement.

---

## Web Integration

- A user-friendly web interface supports image uploads via drag-and-drop or file selection.  
- The backend processes images through the selected model, returning the classification along with confidence scores and optional LIME explanations.  
- The system handles concurrent requests efficiently and operates locally for testing and demonstration.

---

## Results

- The system reliably distinguishes between real and deepfake images with competitive accuracy metrics and delivers real-time feedback through the web UI.  
- Visual output clearly marks images as "FAKE" or "REAL" for ease of understanding.

---

## Limitations

- Model accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of training data. Insufficient datasets may reduce generalization.  
- Computation-intensive models require powerful hardware or GPU acceleration for timely inference.  
- Explanation techniques improve transparency but cannot fully resolve deep model interpretability issues.  
- Local host deployment limits accessibility compared to cloud solutions.  
- Constant evolution of deepfake technology demands ongoing model updates.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective application of deep learning for detecting deepfake images with good accuracy and interpretability. Its integration into a web application improves accessibility and practical usage in media forensics and content verification.

---

## Future Work

- Enhance detection accuracy through advanced architectures such as GAN-based and hybrid deep learning models.  
- Expand to real-time detection suitable for live video streams and conferencing.  
- Improve interpretability with more advanced explainability tools.  
- Develop automated model update mechanisms to adapt to emerging deepfake techniques.  
- Broaden deployment to cloud platforms and mobile applications.  
- Collaborate with policymakers and media organisations for ethical use guidelines and wider adoption.
